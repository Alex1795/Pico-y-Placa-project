# Pico-y-Placa-project
This project implements a predictor to know if at any given day and hour your car can go on the road (based on the 'pico y placa' restriction in the city of Quito) 

The program prompts the user in Spanish as is intended to be used by the people of Quito, which is a spanish speaking city.
In this program I used the modules re and datetime. I also included a unit test file in order to debug and help on future implementations.
I created the Class 'Consulta' because it allows any developer using the code to save each request given to the program, and it might be useful if other applications are developed. 



This program was made using PyCharm and I am the only author of it.
